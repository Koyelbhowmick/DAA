### 1. Activity Selection Problem

**Explanation:**
The activity selection problem is a well-known example of a greedy algorithm. The goal is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a given set of activities. Each activity is defined by a start time and an end time, and two activities are said to overlap if their times intersect.

**Example:**
Consider the following set of activities:

| Activity | Start Time | End Time |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| A1       | 1           | 3        |
| A2       | 2           | 4        |
| A3       | 3           | 5        |
| A4       | 0           | 6        |
| A5       | 5           | 7        |
| A6       | 8           | 9        |
| A7       | 5           | 9        |
| A8       | 8           | 10       |
| A9       | 6           | 10       |

To solve this problem, we aim to maximize the number of activities that do not overlap. 

**Greedy Approach:**
1. **Sort the Activities:** First, we sort the activities based on their end times. This step ensures that we always consider the activity that finishes the earliest, leaving more room for subsequent activities.
2. **Select the First Activity:** The first activity in the sorted list is always selected because it finishes the earliest.
3. **Iterate through the Remaining Activities:** For each subsequent activity, if its start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the last selected activity, we select it.

**Pseudocode:**
``` 
sort activities by end time
select activity 1
for each activity i from 2 to n
    if start[i] >= end[last selected activity]
        select activity i
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
After sorting the activities by end time, we get the following order:
- A1 (1, 3)
- A2 (2, 4)
- A3 (3, 5)
- A4 (0, 6)
- A5 (5, 7)
- A6 (8, 9)
- A7 (5, 9)
- A8 (8, 10)
- A9 (6, 10)

Next, we start with the first activity (A1) and add it to our selection:
- Selected Activities: A1

We then iterate through the rest:
- A2: Start time 2 is less than end time of A1, so it is skipped.
- A3: Start time 3 is equal to end time of A1, so it is selected.
- A4: Start time 0 is less than end time of A3, so it is skipped.
- A5: Start time 5 is equal to end time of A3, so it is selected.
- A6: Start time 8 is greater than end time of A5, so it is selected.
- A7: Start time 5 is less than end time of A5, so it is skipped.
- A8: Start time 8 is less than end time of A6, so it is skipped.
- A9: Start time 6 is less than end time of A6, so it is skipped.

Final selected activities: A1, A3, A5, A6

### 2. Knapsack Problem

**Explanation:**
The knapsack problem is an optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to determine the number of each item to include in the knapsack so that the total weight is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity and the total value is as large as possible.

There are two main variants:
1. **0/1 Knapsack:** Each item can be either taken or not taken (no partial items allowed).
2. **Fractional Knapsack:** Items can be broken into smaller pieces, and fractions of items can be included.

**0/1 Knapsack Example:**
Given:
- Weights: [2, 3, 4, 5]
- Values: [3, 4, 5, 6]
- Capacity: 5

The goal is to maximize the total value without exceeding the capacity of 5.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**
1. **Create a DP Table:** Create a 2D DP table `dp[i][w]` where `i` is the number of items considered and `w` is the capacity. The value `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with `i` items and capacity `w`.
2. **Initialize the Table:** Initialize the first row and first column to 0 because with 0 items or 0 capacity, the maximum value is 0.
3. **Fill the Table:** Use the following rules to fill the table:
   - If the weight of the current item is more than `w`, exclude it.
   - Otherwise, take the maximum of including or excluding the current item.

**Pseudocode:**
```
for i from 0 to n
    for w from 0 to W
        if i == 0 or w == 0
            dp[i][w] = 0
        else if weight[i-1] <= w
            dp[i][w] = max(value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w-weight[i-1]], dp[i-1][w])
        else
            dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
Let's create the DP table step-by-step.

```
Weights: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Values: [3, 4, 5, 6]
Capacity: 5

DP Table Initialization:
   0 1 2 3 4 5
0  0 0 0 0 0 0
1  0 0 3 3 3 3
2  0 0 3 4 4 7
3  0 0 3 4 5 7
4  0 0 3 4 5 7

Final DP Table:
   0 1 2 3 4 5
0  0 0 0 0 0 0
1  0 0 3 3 3 3
2  0 0 3 4 4 7
3  0 0 3 4 5 7
4  0 0 3 4 5 7
```

The maximum value that can be obtained with a capacity of 5 is 7, by selecting items with weights 2 and 3.

### 3. Job Sequencing Problem

**Explanation:**
The job sequencing problem involves scheduling jobs to maximize profit given deadlines. Each job has a deadline and a profit, and each job takes one unit of time. The goal is to find the sequence of jobs that maximizes the total profit without missing any deadlines.

**Example:**
Consider the following jobs with deadlines and profits:

| Job | Profit | Deadline |
|-----|--------|----------|
| J1  | 20     | 2        |
| J2  | 15     | 2        |
| J3  | 10     | 1        |
| J4  | 5      | 3        |

**Greedy Approach:**
1. **Sort Jobs by Profit:** First, sort the jobs in decreasing order of profit.
2. **Assign Jobs to Slots:** Assign each job to the latest possible time slot before its deadline. If a job cannot be scheduled within its deadline, skip it.

**Pseudocode:**
```
sort jobs by profit in descending order
initialize result array and slot array
for each job i
    for each time slot j from min(deadline[i], n) to 1
        if slot[j] is empty
            assign job i to slot j
            break
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
After sorting the jobs by profit:

| Job | Profit | Deadline |
|-----|--------|----------|
| J1  | 20     | 2        |
| J2  | 15     | 2        |
| J3  | 10     | 1        |
| J4  | 5      | 3        |

We initialize the result array and slot array to be empty.

1. **Job J1:** Try to assign J1 to the latest possible slot before its deadline 2.
   - Slot 2 is empty, so assign J1 to slot 2.

2. **Job J2:** Try to assign J2 to the latest possible slot before its deadline 2.
   - Slot 2 is already taken by J1, so assign J2 to slot 1.

3. **Job J3:** Try to assign J3 to the latest possible slot before its deadline 1.
   - Slot 1 is already taken by J2, so skip J3.

4. **Job J4:** Try to assign J4 to the latest possible slot before its deadline 3.
   - Slot 3 is empty, so assign J4 to slot 3.

The final job sequence is: J2, J1, J4 with a total profit of 40.

### 4. Matrix Chain Multiplication

**Explanation:**
Matrix chain

 multiplication is an optimization problem to determine the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices. The goal is to minimize the number of scalar multiplications. Note that matrix multiplication is associative, meaning the order of multiplication can affect the number of operations.

**Example:**
Consider the matrices:
- A1: 10x20
- A2: 20x30
- A3: 30x40

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**
1. **Create a DP Table:** Create a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j.
2. **Initialize the Table:** Initialize `dp[i][i] = 0` because multiplying one matrix requires zero multiplications.
3. **Fill the Table:** Use the following recurrence relation:
   - `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + dimensions[i-1]*dimensions[k]*dimensions[j])` for all k between i and j-1.

**Pseudocode:**
```
for i from 1 to n
    dp[i][i] = 0
for length from 2 to n
    for i from 1 to n-length+1
        j = i+length-1
        dp[i][j] = INF
        for k from i to j-1
            q = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + dimensions[i-1]*dimensions[k]*dimensions[j]
            if q < dp[i][j]
                dp[i][j] = q
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
Let's create the DP table step-by-step.

```
Dimensions: [10, 20, 30, 40]

DP Table Initialization:
   1 2 3
1  0 - -
2  - 0 -
3  - - 0

Filling the Table:
Length = 2
   1 2 3
1  0 6000 -
2  - 0 24000
3  - - 0

Length = 3
   1 2 3
1  0 6000 18000
2  - 0 24000
3  - - 0

Final DP Table:
   1 2 3
1  0 6000 18000
2  - 0 24000
3  - - 0
```

The minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices A1, A2, and A3 is 18000.

### 5. Prim's Algorithm

**Explanation:**
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree (MST) for a weighted undirected graph. An MST is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices in the graph without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

**Example:**
Consider a graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges with weights:
- (A, B, 1)
- (A, C, 3)
- (B, C, 2)
- (B, D, 4)
- (C, D, 5)

**Approach:**
1. **Initialize MST:** Start with any vertex (e.g., A).
2. **Add Minimum Edge:** Select the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
3. **Repeat:** Continue adding edges until all vertices are included in the MST.

**Pseudocode:**
```
initialize a priority queue
add initial vertex to the queue
while queue is not empty
    select the minimum weight edge
    if the edge connects to an unvisited vertex
        add it to the MST
        add the vertex to the queue
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
Let's start with vertex A and build the MST:

1. **Start with A:** Add edges (A, B, 1) and (A, C, 3) to the priority queue.
   - Selected edge: (A, B, 1)

2. **Add B to MST:** Add edges (B, C, 2) and (B, D, 4) to the priority queue.
   - Selected edge: (B, C, 2)

3. **Add C to MST:** Add edge (C, D, 5) to the priority queue.
   - Selected edge: (B, D, 4)

Final MST includes edges: (A, B, 1), (B, C, 2), (B, D, 4).

### 6. Kruskal's Algorithm

**Explanation:**
Kruskal's algorithm is another greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. Unlike Prim's algorithm, which grows the MST one vertex at a time, Kruskal's algorithm grows the MST one edge at a time, ensuring no cycles are formed.

**Example:**
Consider a graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges with weights:
- (A, B, 1)
- (A, C, 3)
- (B, C, 2)
- (B, D, 4)
- (C, D, 5)

**Approach:**
1. **Sort Edges:** Sort all edges by weight.
2. **Add Edges to MST:** Add edges one by one to the MST, ensuring that no cycles are formed.

**Pseudocode:**
```
sort edges by weight
initialize disjoint set for vertices
for each edge in sorted edges
    if edge does not form a cycle
        add it to the MST
        union the sets of the vertices
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
After sorting the edges by weight:

| Edge   | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| (A, B) | 1      |
| (B, C) | 2      |
| (A, C) | 3      |
| (B, D) | 4      |
| (C, D) | 5      |

We initialize the disjoint sets for vertices.

1. **Edge (A, B, 1):** Add to MST.
2. **Edge (B, C, 2):** Add to MST.
3. **Edge (A, C, 3):** Forms a cycle with (A, B) and (B, C), so skip.
4. **Edge (B, D, 4):** Add to MST.
5. **Edge (C, D, 5):** Forms a cycle with (B, C) and (B, D), so skip.

Final MST includes edges: (A, B, 1), (B, C, 2), (B, D, 4).

### 7. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

**Explanation:**
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network. The algorithm uses the concept of residual graphs and augmenting paths. An augmenting path is a path from the source to the sink in the residual graph, where each edge in the path has a positive capacity.

**Example:**
Consider a flow network with vertices {S, A, B, C, T} and edges with capacities:
- (S, A, 10)
- (S, B, 5)
- (A, B, 15)
- (A, C, 10)
- (B, C, 10)
- (B, T, 5)
- (C, T, 10)

**Approach:**
1. **Initialize Flow:** Start with zero flow.
2. **Find Augmenting Path:** Use BFS or DFS to find an augmenting path in the residual graph.
3. **Update Flow:** Increase the flow along the augmenting path by the minimum capacity in the path.
4. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more augmenting paths can be found.

**Pseudocode:**
```
initialize flow to 0
while there is an augmenting path from source to sink
    find the minimum capacity in the path
    increase the flow by this capacity
    update the residual capacities of the edges and reverse edges
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Initial Residual Graph:**

| Edge   | Capacity |
|--------|----------|
| (S, A) | 10       |
| (S, B) | 5        |
| (A, B) | 15       |
| (A, C) | 10       |
| (B, C) | 10       |
| (B, T) | 5        |
| (C, T) | 10       |

2. **Find Augmenting Path:** S -> A -> C -> T
   - Minimum capacity: 10
   - Update flow: 10

3. **Updated Residual Graph:**

| Edge   | Capacity |
|--------|----------|
| (S, A) | 0        |
| (S, B) | 5        |
| (A, B) | 15       |
| (A, C) | 0        |
| (B, C) | 10       |
| (B, T) | 5        |
| (C, T) | 0        |

4. **Find Augmenting Path:** S -> B -> T
   - Minimum capacity: 5
   - Update flow: 5

5. **Final Residual Graph:**

| Edge   | Capacity |
|--------|----------|
| (S, A) | 

0        |
| (S, B) | 0        |
| (A, B) | 15       |
| (A, C) | 0        |
| (B, C) | 10       |
| (B, T) | 0        |
| (C, T) | 0        |

Total maximum flow: 15

### 8. N-Queens Problem

**Explanation:**
The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

**Example:**
For N=4, we need to place 4 queens on a 4x4 board.

**Backtracking Approach:**
1. **Place Queens:** Place queens one by one in different rows, starting from the leftmost column.
2. **Check Safety:** Check if placing a queen in the current cell is safe (i.e., no other queens can attack it).
3. **Backtrack:** If placing the queen leads to a solution, recursively place the next queen. If it doesn't, backtrack and try the next cell.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function solveNQueens(board, col)
    if col >= N
        print solution
        return true
    for each row i in the board
        if isSafe(board, i, col)
            place queen at (i, col)
            if solveNQueens(board, col + 1)
                return true
            remove queen from (i, col)
    return false

function isSafe(board, row, col)
    for each previous column c
        if queen in same row or same diagonal
            return false
    return true
```

**Detailed Solution for N=4:**
1. **Place Queen at (0, 0):**

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Q |   |   |   |
| 1 |   |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |

2. **Place Queen at (1, 1):**

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Q |   |   |   |
| 1 |   | Q |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |

3. **Conflict:** No valid position for the third queen, so backtrack.

4. **Place Queen at (1, 2):**

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Q |   |   |   |
| 1 |   |   | Q |   |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |

5. **Conflict:** No valid position for the fourth queen, so backtrack.

6. **Place Queen at (1, 3):**

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Q |   |   |   |
| 1 |   |   |   | Q |
| 2 |   |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   |   |   |

7. **Conflict:** No valid position for the third queen, so backtrack.

Continue the process until a solution is found. For N=4, the solutions are:

Solution 1:
|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 |   | Q |   |   |
| 1 |   |   |   | Q |
| 2 | Q |   |   |   |
| 3 |   |   | Q |   |

Solution 2:
|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 |   |   | Q |   |
| 1 | Q |   |   |   |
| 2 |   |   |   | Q |
| 3 |   | Q |   |   |

### 9. Graph Problems

**Explanation:**
Graph problems involve various tasks such as finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, finding connected components, and more. Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists.

**Types of Graph Problems:**
1. **Shortest Path:** Find the shortest path between two vertices.
2. **Cycle Detection:** Check if a graph contains cycles.
3. **Connected Components:** Find all connected components in an undirected graph.
4. **Topological Sorting:** Order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

**Example Problems:**
1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** For finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** For finding the shortest path in graphs with negative weights.
3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** For finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

**Detailed Explanation of Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
Dijkstra's algorithm is used for finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

**Pseudocode:**
```
initialize distance to all vertices as INFINITY
distance[source] = 0
initialize priority queue
add source to priority queue
while priority queue is not empty
    extract min distance vertex u
    for each neighbor v of u
        if distance[u] + weight[u][v] < distance[v]
            distance[v] = distance[u] + weight[u][v]
            add v to priority queue
```

**Example:**
Consider the following graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges with weights:
- (A, B, 1)
- (A, C, 4)
- (B, C, 2)
- (B, D, 6)
- (C, D, 3)

Starting from vertex A, the shortest paths to other vertices are:
- Distance to B: 1
- Distance to C: 3 (A -> B -> C)
- Distance to D: 6 (A -> B -> C -> D)

### 10. Hamiltonian Path

**Explanation:**
A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. If such a path exists that starts and ends at the same vertex, it is called a Hamiltonian circuit.

**Example:**
Consider a graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges:
- (A, B), (A, C), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A)

**Backtracking Approach:**
1. **Choose Starting Vertex:** Start from any vertex.
2. **Recursive Exploration:** Recursively visit unvisited vertices.
3. **Check Completion:** If all vertices are visited, return the path.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function hamiltonianPath(graph, path, pos)
    if pos == N
        return true
    for each vertex v in graph
        if v is not in path and is adjacent to the last vertex in path
            add v to path
            if hamiltonianPath(graph, path, pos + 1)
                return true
            remove v from path
    return false

function findHamiltonianPath(graph)
    initialize path
    add starting vertex to path
    if hamiltonianPath(graph, path, 1)
        return path
    return "No Hamiltonian Path"
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Start with Vertex A:**

| Vertex | Path  |
|--------|-------|
| A      | A     |

2. **Visit Vertex B:**

| Vertex | Path  |
|--------|-------|
| A      | A -> B|
| B      |       |

3. **Visit Vertex C:**

| Vertex | Path  |
|--------|-------|
| A      | A -> B -> C|
| B      |             |
| C      |             |

4. **Visit Vertex D:**

| Vertex | Path  |
|--------|-------|
| A      | A -> B -> C -> D|
| B      |                 |
| C      |                 |
| D      |                 |

Final Hamiltonian Path: A -> B -> C -> D

### 11. Union-Find Algorithm

**Explanation:**
Union-Find is a data structure that supports two main operations: union and find. It is used to keep track of disjoint sets and is commonly used in algorithms like Kruskal's for finding the minimum spanning tree.

**Example:**
Consider a set of elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

**Operations:**
1. **Find:** Determine which subset a particular element is in.
2. **Union:** Join two subsets into a single subset.

**Approach:**
1. **Initialize Sets:** Each element starts in its own set.
2. **Union by Rank:** Attach smaller trees under the root of deeper trees.
3. **Path Compression:** Flatten the structure by making each node point directly to the root.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function find(parent, i)
    if parent[i] != i
        parent[i] = find(parent, parent[i])
    return parent[i]

function union

(parent, rank, x, y)
    rootX = find(parent, x)
    rootY = find(parent, y)
    if rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]
        parent[rootX] = rootY
    else if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]
        parent[rootY] = rootX
    else
        parent[rootY] = rootX
        rank[rootX] += 1

function isCycle(graph, V)
    initialize parent and rank arrays
    for each edge (u, v) in graph
        if find(parent, u) == find(parent, v)
            return true
        union(parent, rank, u, v)
    return false
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**

Finally, there are no cycles, and all elements are in a single set.


Sure, let's continue with more detailed explanations for the remaining topics.

### 12. Greedy Approach

**Explanation:**
The greedy approach is a problem-solving paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. It is used for optimization problems where a locally optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.

**Example Problems:**
1. **Activity Selection Problem:** Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Maximize the total value in the knapsack by taking fractions of items.
3. **Huffman Coding:** Minimize the weighted average length of codes.

**Detailed Example: Activity Selection Problem**
Given a set of activities with their start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.

**Example:**
Activities: {1, 3}, {2, 5}, {4, 7}, {1, 8}, {5, 9}, {8, 10}

**Approach:**
1. **Sort Activities:** Sort activities by their end times.
2. **Select Activities:** Iterate through the activities, and select an activity if it starts after or when the previous selected activity ends.

**Pseudocode:**
```
sort activities by end time
selected = []
for each activity in sorted activities
    if activity starts after or when the last selected activity ends
        add activity to selected
return selected
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Sorted Activities:**
   - {1, 3}
   - {2, 5}
   - {4, 7}
   - {1, 8}
   - {5, 9}
   - {8, 10}

2. **Select Activities:**
   - Select {1, 3} (first activity).
   - {2, 5} overlaps with {1, 3}, so skip.
   - Select {4, 7}.
   - {1, 8} overlaps with {4, 7}, so skip.
   - {5, 9} overlaps with {4, 7}, so skip.
   - Select {8, 10}.

**Final Selected Activities:** {1, 3}, {4, 7}, {8, 10}

### 13. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Explanation:**
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. It uses a priority queue to explore the minimum distance vertex first.

**Example:**
Consider a graph with vertices {A, B, C, D} and edges with weights:
- (A, B, 1)
- (A, C, 4)
- (B, C, 2)
- (B, D, 6)
- (C, D, 3)

**Approach:**
1. **Initialize Distances:** Set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and all others to infinity.
2. **Priority Queue:** Use a priority queue to select the vertex with the minimum distance.
3. **Update Distances:** For each neighbor of the selected vertex, update its distance if a shorter path is found.

**Pseudocode:**
```
initialize distance to all vertices as INFINITY
distance[source] = 0
initialize priority queue
add source to priority queue
while priority queue is not empty
    extract min distance vertex u
    for each neighbor v of u
        if distance[u] + weight[u][v] < distance[v]
            distance[v] = distance[u] + weight[u][v]
            add v to priority queue
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Initialize Distances:**
   - Distance to A: 0
   - Distance to B: ∞
   - Distance to C: ∞
   - Distance to D: ∞

2. **Priority Queue:** [(A, 0)]

3. **Iteration 1:** Extract A (0)
   - Update B: 1 (A -> B)
   - Update C: 4 (A -> C)
   - Priority Queue: [(B, 1), (C, 4)]

4. **Iteration 2:** Extract B (1)
   - Update C: 3 (A -> B -> C)
   - Update D: 7 (A -> B -> D)
   - Priority Queue: [(C, 3), (C, 4), (D, 7)]

5. **Iteration 3:** Extract C (3)
   - Update D: 6 (A -> B -> C -> D)
   - Priority Queue: [(C, 4), (D, 6), (D, 7)]

6. **Iteration 4:** Extract C (4), no updates.
7. **Iteration 5:** Extract D (6), no updates.

**Final Distances:**
- Distance to B: 1
- Distance to C: 3
- Distance to D: 6

### 14. Pseudocode

**Explanation:**
Pseudocode is a high-level description of an algorithm that uses the structural conventions of programming but omits detailed syntax. It is used to design and explain algorithms in a clear and concise manner.

**Example:**
Let's write pseudocode for the classic "Binary Search" algorithm.

**Binary Search:**
Binary Search is used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the array in each step.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function binarySearch(arr, target)
    initialize low = 0
    initialize high = length of arr - 1
    while low <= high
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if arr[mid] == target
            return mid
        else if arr[mid] < target
            low = mid + 1
        else
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Variables:** Set `low` to the beginning of the array and `high` to the end of the array.
2. **Loop Until Found:** Repeat until `low` is greater than `high`.
3. **Calculate Middle:** Find the middle index.
4. **Compare and Adjust:** Compare the middle element with the target. If they are equal, return the index. If the middle element is less than the target, adjust `low` to `mid + 1`. If the middle element is greater than the target, adjust `high` to `mid - 1`.
5. **Return Result:** If the target is not found, return -1.

### 15. Quick Sort

**Explanation:**
Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two halves: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the two halves.

**Example:**
Consider the array [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1].

**Approach:**
1. **Select Pivot:** Choose a pivot element from the array.
2. **Partition:** Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
3. **Recursively Sort:** Recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays formed by partitioning.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function quickSort(arr, low, high)
    if low < high
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1)
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high)

function partition(arr, low, high)
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1
    for j = low to high - 1
        if arr[j] < pivot
            i = i + 1
            swap arr[i] and arr[j]
    swap arr[i + 1] and arr[high]
    return i + 1
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Initial Array:** [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
2. **Select Pivot:** Choose 1 as pivot.
3. **Partition:** Rearrange array:
   - [1, 6, 8, 10, 3, 2, 1] (swap 1 and 3)
   - [1, 1, 8, 10, 3, 2, 6] (swap 6 and 1)
4. **Recursively Sort Sub-arrays:** Apply the same process to [1, 1] and [8, 10, 3, 2, 6].

Final sorted array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]

### 16. Merge Sort

**Explanation:**
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

**Example:**
Consider the array [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10].

**Approach:**
1. **Divide:** Divide the array into two halves.
2. **Recursively Sort:** Recursively sort each half.
3. **Merge:** Merge the two sorted halves.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function mergeSort(arr)
    if length of arr > 1
        mid = length of arr / 2
        left = arr[0:mid]
        right = arr[mid:length of

 arr]
        mergeSort(left)
        mergeSort(right)
        merge(arr, left, right)

function merge(arr, left, right)
    i = j = k = 0
    while i < length of left and j < length of right
        if left[i] < right[j]
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i = i + 1
        else
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
    while i < length of left
        arr[k] = left[i]
        i = i + 1
        k = k + 1
    while j < length of right
        arr[k] = right[j]
        j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Initial Array:** [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
2. **Divide:**
   - Left: [38, 27, 43]
   - Right: [3, 9, 82, 10]
3. **Recursively Sort Left:**
   - [38]
   - [27, 43]
4. **Merge Left:**
   - [27, 38, 43]
5. **Recursively Sort Right:**
   - [3, 9]
   - [82, 10]
6. **Merge Right:**
   - [3, 9]
   - [10, 82]
7. **Merge Right:**
   - [3, 9, 10, 82]

Final sorted array: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]

### 17. Heap Sort

**Explanation:**
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It involves building a max-heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and reconstructing the heap.

**Example:**
Consider the array [4, 10, 3, 5, 1].

**Approach:**
1. **Build Max-Heap:** Convert the array into a max-heap.
2. **Extract Max:** Repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap and rebuild the heap.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function heapSort(arr)
    n = length of arr
    for i = n / 2 - 1 down to 0
        heapify(arr, n, i)
    for i = n - 1 down to 0
        swap arr[0] and arr[i]
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

function heapify(arr, n, i)
    largest = i
    left = 2 * i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2
    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]
        largest = left
    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]
        largest = right
    if largest != i
        swap arr[i] and arr[largest]
        heapify(arr, n, largest)
```

**Detailed Solution for the Example:**
1. **Initial Array:** [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]
2. **Build Max-Heap:** Convert to [10, 5, 3, 4, 1]
3. **Extract Max:**
   - [10, 5, 3, 4, 1] -> [1, 5, 3, 4] (swap 10 and 1)
   - [5, 4, 3, 1] (rebuild heap)
   - [5, 4, 3, 1] -> [1, 4, 3, 5] (swap 5 and 1)
   - [4, 3, 1] (rebuild heap)
   - [4, 3, 1] -> [1, 3, 4] (swap 4 and 1)
   - [3, 1] (rebuild heap)
   - [3, 1] -> [1, 3] (swap 3 and 1)

Final sorted array: [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]

### 18. Time and Space Complexity

**Explanation:**
Time and space complexity are measures of the efficiency of an algorithm. Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, while space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses.

**Big O Notation:**
Big O notation describes the upper bound of the complexity, representing the worst-case scenario.

**Common Time Complexities:**
1. **O(1):** Constant time
2. **O(log n):** Logarithmic time
3. **O(n):** Linear time
4. **O(n log n):** Linearithmic time
5. **O(n^2):** Quadratic time
6. **O(2^n):** Exponential time
7. **O(n!):** Factorial time

**Example:**
Consider a simple loop that prints each element of an array.

**Pseudocode:**
```
function printArray(arr)
    for each element in arr
        print(element)
```

**Time Complexity Analysis:**
- The loop runs n times (where n is the number of elements in the array).
- Each iteration takes constant time O(1).
- Total time complexity: O(n) * O(1) = O(n).

**Space Complexity Analysis:**
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (for the loop variable and index).
- Space complexity: O(1).
